Coding challenges aren't just on whiteboards. Oftentimes, programmers will need to solve problems through a screen-sharing program like CoderPad or SpaceCraft. While it's easy to draw what your data structure should look like on a whiteboard, it's a tedious process to use `puts` to log your data structure to the console.

With Lander, it's easy to log your data structure to the console and gain a clearer sense of what's happening in your code. Just call the appropriate method in your program and your data structure will be displayed when you execute it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lander'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lander
